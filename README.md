## üè¢ Work Experience
### Data Scientist Intern @ British Airways (January 2024)
I recently participated in British Airway's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Data Science team at British Airways.
I worked on a project where I analysed customer insights and built predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. I practiced my data analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my PowerPoing and communication skills by presenting insights a real-world context.

### Data Science Internship @ BCG (May 2024)
Completed a customer churn analysis simulation for XYZ Analytics, demonstrating advanced data analytics skills, identifying essential client data and outlining a strategic investigation approach.
Conducted efficient data analysis using Python, including Pandas and NumPy. Employed data visualization techniques for insightful trend interpretation.
Completed the engineering and optimization of a random forest model, achieving an 85% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn.
Completed a concise executive summary for the Associate Director, delivering actionable insights for informed decision-making based on the analysis.
